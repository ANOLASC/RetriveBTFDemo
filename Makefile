# Setting -DHAVE_ATTR_TEST=0 for the kernel containing below patch:
# 06f84d1989b7 perf tools: Make usage of test_attr__* optional for perf-sys.h
#
# The patch was included in Linus's tree starting v5.5-rc1, but was also included
# in stable kernel branch linux-5.4.y. So it's hard to determine whether a kernel
# is affected based on the kernel version alone:
# - for a v5.4 kernel from Linus's tree, no;
# - for a v5.4 kernel from the stable tree (used by many distros), yes.
#
# So let's look at the actual kernel source code to decide.
